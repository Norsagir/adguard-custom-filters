# AdGuard custom filters

Here are some files providing filters for AdGuard (may be working with other adblockers like uBlock).

## Adding a filter via github

For AdGuard :
1. Click on the file you want
2. Click on "Raw"
3. Go to Adguard configuration, select 'Filters', then 'Custom'
4. Click 'Add', then copy-paste the github URL you got by clicking 'Raw' previously
5. Save and enjoy

## Customizing a filter

You can fork this repo for sure !
You can copy-paste these files in the 'User rules' of AdGuard too, then you can modify them as you want.
