# AdGuard custom filters

Here are some files providing filters for AdGuard (may be working with other adblockers like uBlock).

## Adding a filter via github

For AdGuard :
1. Click on the filter's file you want (the ones with .txt)
2. Click on "Raw"
3. Go to Adguard configuration, select 'Filters', then 'Custom'
4. Click 'Add', then copy-paste the github URL you got by clicking 'Raw' previously
5. Save and enjoy

## Customizing a filter

You can fork this repo for sure !

You can copy-paste these files in the 'User rules' of AdGuard too, then you can modify them as you want.

## Importing my personal config file

My personal config file 'Personal AdGuard configuration.json' allows me to avoid ads and social media tweaks.

Right now in December 2024, I've been using it for over 4 years without a problem.

You can still edit the config : once you imported it, nothing will prevent you from modifying the imported configuration via the admin page of Adguard.
